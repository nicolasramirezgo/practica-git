<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Product Manager with experience in digital products, innovation, and cross-functional team leadership. My background combines Industrial Engineering 
  and a Masterâ€™s in Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship, which allows me to connect business, technology, and design to build products that create 
  real market value.</p>


<p>I have worked across traditional industries and tech companies, managing physical product portfolios as well as leading software development. 
  This path gave me a complete perspective: scaling products in established organizations and driving ideas from zero to traction in startups.</p>


<p>Today, I focus on helping founders and teams build successful digital products, applying frameworks such as Lean Startup, Design Thinking, Scrum, and 
  Product Discovery, inspired by thought leaders like Marty Cagan and Teresa Torres.</p>

  <p>I am also deeply interested in sustainability and well-being, striving to ensure that innovation is not only profitable but also responsible and 
    human-centered.</p>


  <p>Currently, I am based in Hanoi, Vietnam, supporting my wife in her international career, while collaborating with startup incubators to connect talent 
    and opportunities across Latin America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
